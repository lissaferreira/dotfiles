# Workflow

I use I3wm as my window manager. I3wm is a very simple to use window manager, fast, and minimal in RAM/CPU use.

To rice my bar, I use Polybar. Polybar have a lot of modules and configs for each part of the bar. Like clock, workspaces, RAM use,etc.

To display notifications, I use Dunst. Dunst is a simple notification manager, it can display notifications from Discord, Kdenlive,etc. in a customized way.

To run aplications, I use [my Dmenu build](https://github.com/lissaferreira/dmenu-lissaferreira), a suckless aplication runner.

To code and edit text, I use Neovim, a editor with a lot of mappings to delete, edit, add, move around the text,etc. specifically [LunarVim](https://www.lunarvim.org/) configs.

As terminal emulator, I use Alacritty, a fast terminal written in Rust language, and Alacritty fits perfectly with window managers like I3wm

And to install AUR packages, I use Paru, a useful program to install AUR packages.
